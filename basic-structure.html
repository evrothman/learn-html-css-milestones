      <h2> The Old Man and the Sea </h2>
    <p> He was an old man who fished alone in a skiff in the Gulf Stream and he had gone eighty-four
days now without taking a fish. In the first forty days a boy had been with him. But after forty days
without a fish the boy’s parents had told him that the old man was now definitely and finally salao,
which is the worst form of unlucky, and the boy had gone at their orders in another boat which
caught three good fish the first week. It made the boy sad to see the old man come in each day with
his skiff empty and he always went down to help him carry either the coiled lines or the gaff and
harpoon and the sail that was furled around the mast. The sail was patched with flour sacks and,
furled, it looked like the flag of permanent defeat. </p>
    <p>The old man was thin and gaunt with deep wrinkles in the back of his neck. The brown
blotches of the benevolent skin cancer the sun brings from its [9] reflection on the tropic sea were
on his cheeks. The blotches ran well down the sides of his face and his hands had the deep-creased
scars from handling heavy fish on the cords. But none of these scars were fresh. They were as old as

    <p> Everything about him was old except his eyes and they were the same color as the sea and were
cheerful and undefeated... </P>
  <h2> For Whom the Bells Toll </h2>
  <p> He lay flat on the brown, pine-needled floor of the forest, his chin on his folded arms,
and high overhead the wind blew in the tops of the pine trees. The mountainside sloped
gently where he lay; but below it was steep and he could see the dark of the oiled road
winding through the pass. There was a stream alongside the road and far down the
pass he saw a mill beside the stream and the falling water of the dam, white in the
summer sunlight. </p>
  <p>  “Is that the mill?” he asked. <br>
 “Yes.” <br>
 “I do not remember it.” <br>
 “It was built since you were here. The old mill is farther down; much below the pass.” </p>
 <p>  “It was built since you were here. The old mill is farther down; much below the pass.”
 He spread the photostated military map out on the forest floor and looked at it
carefully. The old man looked over his shoulder. He was a short and solid old man in a
black peasant’s smock and gray iron-stiff trousers and he wore rope-soled shoes. He
was breathing heavily from the climb and his hand rested on one of the two heavy packs
they had been carrying... </p>
