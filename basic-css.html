    <p> I took this photo years ago in a small town called Eaglesmere.</p>
<!-- This does not have the background color of the other paragraph.
This is becasue a paragraph within a div is more specific than just a paragraph-->
<h2> I also need to add a list </h2>
    <ul>
      <li> Eaglesmere is in Pennsylvania</li>
      <li> Its also in the Mountains </li>
      <li> When I was younger, I was fascinated by the fact that there was
         this large lake on the top of a mountain </li>
<!-- even though these list items have not been directly edited by CSS
because they are within the unordered list that has been, those changes effect
the list items. -->
</ul>
