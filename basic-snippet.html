<h3> What does each element in this snippet do? </h3>
<ul>
  <li> p: this creates a "paragraph" element in which everything else is contained. Just like a
  paragraph in a book, this seperates blocks of text from each other.
    <ul>
      <li> <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_p.asp" target="_blank">W3 Schools Paragraph Tag</a></li>
      <li> <a  href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/p" target="_blank">Mozilla on the Paragraph Tag</a></li>
    </ul></li>
  <li> a: this tag is know as the anchor element and is what tells the web page that you are linking to another webpage, and its oppening and closing
  tags surround the display text for the link, in this case "Google"
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_a.asp" target="_blank">W3 Schools Hyperlink Tag</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/a" target="_blank">Mozilla Anchor tag information</a></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li> href: this attribute signals the speficic web page that you are linking to </li>
  <li> id: this attribute identifies the element "a" to your css styles sheet, and an id can
    only be used once per html page, so it is the most specific identifier you can use </li>
  <li> class: this attribute is similar to an id, but can be used for many element, and is therefore a less specific
    identifier. If an element has a class and an id, the id will overrule the styles set by the class. </li>
  <li> target: this attribute tells your browser where to open the link you've created, which in this case is
    a new page.</li>
  </ul>
